This directory contains all stuff dealing with native code in MiToBo:

- external
  third-party libraries taken "as they are" for usage with MiToBo

- hybrid
  third-party libraries or parts of them, partially modified,
  to run with MiToBo

- internal
  MiToBo's own native code 

Note that all libs are compiled for different architectures. 
Usually the following architectures are supported:

- Linux, 32-bit
- Windows, 32-bit

Important notice:
=================

For 64-bit linux providing a single self-contained dynamic library is no 
longer possible due to linker restrictions. Accordingly only an internal 
MiToBo library is provided, which however depends on several system libraries 
that have to be installed on the target system to allow MiToBo native code to 
be used. In detail, we require

- CGAL
- gmp
- mpfr
- boost

For building the native libraries for Windows and 32-bit machines you need 
to have installed the following packages on your machine:

- gcc-multilib / g++-multilib
- libc6-dev-i386 / libc6-dev-x86
- bjam
- mingw32
- m4

In addition, standard tools like make/configure/cmake are 
obligatory.

Important notice:
=================

For building the libs the correct order of compiling is essential!
Always proceed as follows:

1. build external libs (at least gml / mpfr / boost)

2. build hybrid lib

3. build internal libs
