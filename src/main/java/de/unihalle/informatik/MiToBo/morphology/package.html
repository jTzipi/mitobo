Provides classes for morphological processing of binary images.
<p>
This package provides a selection of java classes for performing morphological
operations on binary images. On the one hand classical morphological operators,
e.g. erosion, dilation, distance transforms, can be found here. On the other
hand the package also includes classes related to image morphology only in a 
broader sense. Linking adjacent image regions in a binary image is an example
of those pseudo-morphological operators.
