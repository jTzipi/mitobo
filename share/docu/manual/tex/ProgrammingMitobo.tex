\mitobo contains a selection of different operators for image analysis which can readily 
be applied to solve specific problems. While the first part of this guide shows how operators 
can be executed within ImageJ and via commandline, in this second part we are discussing how 
operators can be invoked on the programmatic level (Sec.~\ref{sec:callOp}). 
Moreover, we not only show how to use existing
operators, but we also introduce you to the basics of writing operators on your own 
(Sec.~\ref{sec:makeOp}). This becomes
necessary, e.g., if the existing \mitobo operators do not suit your needs, if you
would like to benefit from \mitobo's support for automatically generating graphical and 
commandline interfaces for your own algorithms, or if you would like to have your own analysis 
procedures automatically documented. Note that as \mitobo operators are basically \alida operators 
here we will focus on the substantial basics of writing \mitobo operators in the context of 
ImageJ. For more general details about implementing operators in general please refer to the 
\alida programmer's guide where much more details about \alida's concepts can be found.
