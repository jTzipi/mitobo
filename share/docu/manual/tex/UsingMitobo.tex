\mitobo ships with a large collection of image analysis operators, basically developed for
microscope image processing and analysis, however, applicable to any other image analysis
task as well. After \mitobo was successfully installed (please refer to its
website, \href{http://www.informatik.uni-halle.de/mitobo}{http://www.informatik.uni-halle.de/mitobo}, for details
on the installation procedure) you can directly use the operators and plugins of the toolbox like any other ImageJ plugin 
(Sec.~\ref{sec:opRunImageJ}). In addition, \mitobo provides a commandline tool for running operators, e.g., from shell scripts
(Sec.~\ref{sec:opRunCmdline}). 
Irrespective of how an operator is invoked, after termination processing histories can be accessed and explored for all result 
data objects (Sec.~\ref{sec:history}). 
Finally, if you require to combine various operators into a more complex workflow for solving your specific problem, the graphical 
editor {\tt Grappa} offers support for doing this in a comfortable graphical manner (Sec.~\ref{sec:grappa}).
