  abstract = {Scratch assays are a widely used technique for assessing the migratory
	potential of cells. However, due to a lack of appropriate tools these assays 
        are often analyzed manually. Here we present a plugin for the automatic	
	segmentation and analysis of scratch assay images. The input images
	are segmented using a topology-preserving non-PDE level set approach. 
        To exclude images where the scratch has	already been completely closed a support	
	vector machine separates images containing a scratch from such that
	do not. As our method requires adjustment of only two parameters, 
        it is easy to use and has already been successfully applied in practice.},

  abstract = {Cell migration assessment is often done by scratch assay experiments
	for which quantitative evaluations are usually performed manually.
	Here we present an automatic analysis pipeline detecting scratch
	boundaries and measuring areas based on level sets. We extend non-PDE
	level sets for topology-preservation and use an entropy-based energy
	functional. This approach by design segments a scratch in every image,
	hence, we employ support vector machines to identify images showing
	no scratch at all. Compared to other algorithms our approach, implemented
	as ImageJ plugin, relies on a minimal set of parameters. Experimental
	evaluations show the high quality of results and their suitability
	for biomedical investigations.},

  abstract = {Parametric active contour models, commonly denoted as snakes, provide
	an integrated framework for transforming object segmentation tasks into 
        well-founded mathematical optimization problems. Over the years snakes
	have proven large flexibility in segmenting a great variety of different
	objects in lots of setups. Nevertheless, each new object segmentation problem 
        again raises the question if snakes are capable of solving the problem
	and if so, which combination of energies to apply. Here we present
	our ImageJ plugin 'SnakeOptimizer' which implements object segmentation 
        based on 2D parametric active contours.	It is well-suited to support users in
	answering the above questions during rapid-prototyping stages, as
	well as for being integrated into productive analysis workflows. 
        The functional core of the implementation can easily be extended with new energy models
	based on functionality provided by Alida.1 The ImageJ plugin features
	a handy GUI for interactive use, and the optimizer can also be run headless from 
        command line or on the programming level using its intuitive API.},
